    <h3> Textile Crafts </h3>
    <p> Something that I am very interested in is textile crafts. During the pandemic I found that I was lacking in a fun and creative hobby that could calm me down in that stressful time, so I decided to learn how to knit. Since then, I have also picked up sewing and crochet, and I practice all of these crafts frequently to destress and express myself. Here is a link to a site where you can learn how to knit too: </p>

    <h3> Environmental Science/Activism </h3>
    <p> Another thing that I am interested in (though this is something I would like to do as a career rather than a hobby) is environmental science and climate activism. I strongly believe that serious action needs to be taken for the wellbeing and safety of all living things on Earth. When I am older, I would like to contribute to this cause by finding solutions for this issue or fighting for them. Here is a link to a documentary that sparked my interested in environmental action: </p>
