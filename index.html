    <h1> Hello, World! </h1>
    <p> My name is Anita Kay and I am currently a grade 10 student at Immaculata. </p>
    <h3> My favourite pastimes:</h3>
    <p> My favourite pastimes include sports such as skating, skiing, and basketball. I also enjoy more creative activities such as crochet, knitting, making clay sculptures, and sewing. I enjoy these activities because they allow me to express myself in different and rewarding ways.</p>
    <h3> My favourite and least favourite subjects: </h3>
    <p> My favourite subject in school is definitely mathematics. I really enjoy the subject because I like that everything is logical and makes provable sense. My least favourite subject is probably religion because, in my opinion, there is too much grey area that can be contested.</p>
